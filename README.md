THEDAL – A Multilingual Scholarship Matching Web Application

Description:

THEDAL is an exclusive web-based platform designed to bring together all government and private scholarships under one digital roof. It helps students easily find and apply for scholarships they are eligible for by analyzing their personal, academic, and financial details.

The system provides three types of logins — Student, Institution, and Admin — each with dedicated dashboards and functionalities. Students can create profiles, get personalized scholarship suggestions, and track their application status. Institutions can manage student data and monitor scholarship participation, while Admins can manage and publish scholarships across categories.

THEDAL also features a multilingual interface (English, Tamil, Hindi), an AI-powered chatbot for guidance, and an intuitive UI with responsive design, header/footer navigation, and smart filters for State, Central, and Private scholarships. By centralizing all opportunities in one accessible platform, THEDAL simplifies the entire scholarship process for both students and administrators.
